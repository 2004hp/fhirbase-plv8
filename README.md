## Live Demo

Here is an [interactive demo](http://try-fhirplace.hospital-systems.com/fhirface/index.html).


## Motivation

While crafting Health IT systems you begin to understand a value of properly chosen domain model.
FHIR is an open source new generation lightweight standard for health data interoperability,
which (we hope) could be used as a foundationan for Health IT systems. FHIR is based on a concept of __resource__.

> FHIR® is a next generation standards framework created by HL7.
> FHIR combines the best features of HL7 Version 2,
> Version 3 and CDA® product lines while leveraging the latest
> web standards and applying a tight focus on implementability.


## Why PostgreSQL?

> PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.
> It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture
> that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.
