# FHIRBase Introduction

FHIRBase is a PostgreSQL extension for storing and retrieving
[FHIR resources](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/resources.html). You
can interact with FHIRBase using any PostgreSQL client. We advise you
to start with [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/), because it has
easy-to-use graphical interface. However,
[other options](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Community_Guide_to_PostgreSQL_GUI_Tools)
are available.

[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is the language in which you
"talk" to FHIRBase. If you don't have at least basic knowledge of SQL,
we strongly advise to read some books or tutorials on the Web in the
first place.

We assume that you have successfully
[installed FHIRBase](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirplace#installation)
using Vagrant and already configured connection parameters in your
PostgreSQL client.

## Stored Procedures as primary API

In SQL world it's conventional to insert data with `INSERT` statement,
delete it with `DELETE`, update with `UPDATE` and so on. FHIRBase uses
less common approach - it forces you to use
[stored procedures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure) for
data manipulation. Reason for this is that FHIRBase needs to perform
additional actions on data changes to keep FHIR-specific functionality
(such as
[search](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html) and
[versioning](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html#vread))
working.

There are some exceptions from this rule in data retrieval cases. For
example you can `SELECT ... FROM resource` to search for specific
resource or set of resources. But when you create, delete or modify
something, you have to use corresponding stored procedure.

## Creating resources

Just after installation FHIRBase is "empty", it doesn't have any data
we can operate with. So let's create some resources first.
